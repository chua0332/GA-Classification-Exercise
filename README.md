# GA-Classification-Exercise
In this project, I will the training several ML models to predict employee's churn. From there, I will be picking the model with the best Recall and AUROC score. On hindsight, this is useful and important to the business because it helps to supplement both employee satisfaction surveys as well as exit interviews by pre-empting employers which employees have the higher probability of leaving the organisation.
